This phase of the project examines the problem of managing records for a fleet of motor vehicles for rent. 


The application has the following features:

•	Records kilometres travelled and fuel costs

•	Displays fuel economy and average fuel cost

The application implements the three classes:

- A Vehicle class

- A Journey class

- A FuelPurchase class

In your pairs you will now take the basic program from GitHub and add in the following to your code:

- A Vehicle class (PrintToScreen method must also print the total revenue and number of km since the vehicle's last service)
